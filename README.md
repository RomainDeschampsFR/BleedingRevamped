# Bleeding Revamped

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.

Original mod from Deus

It makes:
1) Small wounds stop bleeding after a while, so killing bear with revolver shoot in the foot will be very unlikely.
2) Moose bleed now, but in most cases far too little to kill it.
3) Bleeding now properly stack. Shooting wildlife more than one time will cause the bleeding rates to add. (In vanilla, only the stronger one is used. All other wounds are ignored.)
4) Bleeding now causes condition loss. (In vanilla, no HP is lost from bleeding.)
5) It randomizes the bleeding times a bit, so players can have luck and hit the aorta vein.
6) Wildlife now slowly regenerate HP so wounds will disappear after some time.
